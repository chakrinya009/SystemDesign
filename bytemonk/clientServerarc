In client server architecture client request services or resources from servers, which respond to these requests and provide the necessary functionality or data

A server is the one who provides requested services.
Clients are the ones who request services.



The user enters the uniform resource locator (URL) of the website or file and the browser sends a request to the domain name system (DNS) server.
DNS server is responsible for searching and retrieving the IP address associated with a web server and then initiating actions using that IP address.
After the DNS server responds, the browser sends over an HTTP or HTTPS request to the web serverâ€™s IP, which was provided by the DNS server.
Following the request, the server proceeds to transmit the essential website files required.
Ultimately, the files are processed by the browser and the website is subsequently presented for viewing.
